            What is MyImager?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg ">
            MyImager is a cloud-based image hosting service, similar to
            Firebase, designed to store your images and provide fast access
            through a unique URL. With MyImager, you can upload your images,
            manage them efficiently, and easily share the URLs with your users
            or within your applications.

            How does it work?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg ">
            Once you upload an image to MyImager, the system stores it securely
            and provides you with a direct URL to access the image. You can then
            use this URL to display or share the image within your application
            or website. It's a hassle-free way to manage your images and scale
            your projects without worrying about storage limitations or
            infrastructure.
